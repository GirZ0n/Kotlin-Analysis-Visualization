# Kotlin Imports
This app will allow you to visualize the statistics of import directives in Kotlin that were gathered using [Lupa](https://github.com/nbirillo/Lupa) framework.

## Glossary
- Import directive: `import com.google.gson.Gson`;
- Fully qualified name of import directive (FQ name): `com.google.gson.Gson`.

## Data
The collected data can be found [here](https://github.com/GirZ0n/Lupa-Visualization/tree/main/resources/kotlin_imports/data).

## Pages
There are three pages in the visualization:

1. Statistics for all imports: the statistics for all FQ names are visualized here.
2. Statistics without Android projects: the statistics for all FQ names, except those collected from Android projects, are visualized here.
3. Custom statistics: page, where you can, using existing visualization algorithms, view statistics for any other dataset.
