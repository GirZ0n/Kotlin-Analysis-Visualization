# Python Imports
This application will allow you to visualize the statistics of imports in Python that were gathered using [Kotlin-Analysis](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/Kotlin-Analysis).

The collected data can be found [here](../../resources/python_imports/data).

## How to view
[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/girz0n/kotlin-analysis-visualization/main/src/python_imports/app.py)

Or you can run the visualization locally:

streamlit run app.py
